# macOS Setup

## Information
Please, do not use my setup as is. If you want to try it out, I suggest you to fork this repo, review the code and tweak it to your needs. Don't blindly run it, because it may not be something that you want/need.

## Warning
Some of these files require iCloud and specific data to be stored in them for auto-sync. Only sublime-text uses this feature at time being, but I may use it more often if I find appropriate usage for another app. Sublime's `User` folder is being synced (settings, preferences & snippets)

## Installation
`mkdir ~/.dot && curl -L "https://github.com/dvLden/mac-setup/tarball/master" | tar -xz -C ~/.dot --strip-components=1 && cd ~/.dot && sh bootstrap`
